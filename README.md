# 2.5D Fighting Game
Develop fully in python with PyGame as a highschool project. Because PyGame takes care of rendering, it is highly unoptimized especially for 3D worldspaces which was used in this project.

# Current Situation
Because of poor documentation and poor performance with the implementation this project is abandoned.

# Succesor

Using what I learned in this project, I applied to them a different project to learn more about Java and Opengl. Better documentation and design documents, following more inline with traditional encapsulation practices.
